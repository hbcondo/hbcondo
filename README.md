I'm a Polyglot Technology Executive with proven track record directing small and large teams of 40+ to dozens of product launches in multiple industries using Agile, Squad, ITIL, CMMI, Zachman, TOGAF and Twelve-Factor App SDLC methodologies and architecture frameworks. I managed operational & capital budgets over $5M per annum and established IT strategy / roadmaps for a $1B company. I'm experienced operating at high scale—trillions of data points —with high availability, providing always-on alerting, visualization and tracing for infrastructure and applications globally. I also graduated above 90th percentile of students from top-tier CS school and was a teacher of software analysis & design.
